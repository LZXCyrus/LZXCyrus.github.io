## Introduction

* **What is EKG**: Event-centric knowledge representation from Knowledge Graph (KG) ,which is a popular knowledge representation form. 

* **The purpose of the article**: Introduce how EKG comes into being, what is called an EKG, how to construct it, and further where it can be applied.

* **How to introduce EKG**: From history, ontology, instance, and application views.

* **How to introduce EKG**: Focuse on event extraction, event modeling and mining, event and event relation extractions, and event coreference resolution

## Historical view of EKG

1. KG: Entities
2. Event Graph: Events consisting of triggers and arguments (subject, object, time, and location)
3. Event-centric KG: Events identified by URIs and entities
4. Event evolutionary graph: Events (i.e., abstract, generalized, and semantically complete verb phrases)
5. Event-centric temporal KG: events, entities, and relations
6. Event logic graph: Abstract, generalized, and semantically complete event tuples (s, p, o)

## Ontology view of EKG

### Event Schema Induction 

Definition :
$$
{𝑇_0,𝑇_1, ...,𝑇_𝑙} ( 𝑎 𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑠) \\ 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔  {𝑡𝑝_0, ...,𝑡𝑝_𝜏  }   (𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒𝑠) \\ {𝑟𝑙_0^𝑖,...,𝑟𝑙_𝜌^𝑖 }    (𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 𝑡𝑝_𝑖) 
$$

Supervised methods are applied in early studies. They learn from annotated data and then induce event schema from new texts.

Semi-supervised methods start with a few annotated seeds to induce event schema. Patwardhan and Riloff(2007):domain-relevant event schema via semantic affinity.

Unsupervised methods remove the requirements of annotated data. Yuan(2018):They first detected event types by clustering news articles.

### Script Induction

The “events” in scripts, called script events, are event schema rather than instances.

Challenge:(1) The main challenge is to learn the scenario-specific argument roles automatically. (2)It is still a problem to learn high-quality scenario-specific argument roles effectively and efficiently
