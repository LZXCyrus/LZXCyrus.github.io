## Introduction

* **What is EKG**: Event-centric knowledge representation from Knowledge Graph (KG) ,which is a popular knowledge representation form. 

* **The purpose of the article**: Introduce how EKG comes into being, what is called an EKG, how to construct it, and further where it can be applied.

* **How to introduce EKG**: From history, ontology, instance, and application views.

* **How to introduce EKG**: Focuse on event extraction, event modeling and mining, event and event relation extractions, and event coreference resolution

## Historical view of EKG

1. KG: Entities
2. Event Graph: Events consisting of triggers and arguments (subject, object, time, and location)
3. Event-centric KG: Events identified by URIs and entities
4. Event evolutionary graph: Events (i.e., abstract, generalized, and semantically complete verb phrases)
5. Event-centric temporal KG: events, entities, and relations
6. Event logic graph: Abstract, generalized, and semantically complete event tuples (s, p, o)

## Ontology view of EKG

### Event Schema Induction 

Definition
:   {T_0,T_1,...,T_L}  (a set of texts)
    including {tp_0,...,tp_τ}  (all event types)
    {rl_0^i,...,rl_p^i}  (all argument roles for each event type tp_i)

Supervised methods are applied in early studies. They learn from annotated data and then induce event schema from new texts.

Semi-supervised methods start with a few annotated seeds to induce event schema. Patwardhan and Riloff(2007):domain-relevant event schema via semantic affinity.

Unsupervised methods remove the requirements of annotated data. Yuan(2018):They first detected event types by clustering news articles.

### Script Induction

The “events” in scripts, called script events, are event schema rather than instances.

Challenge:(1) The main challenge is to learn the scenario-specific argument roles automatically. (2)It is still a problem to learn high-quality scenario-specific argument roles effectively and efficiently

### EKG Schema Induction

The Definition of EKG
:  G={(s,p,o)|{s,p}∈N, p∈E, N=N_evt∪N_ent, E=E_{evt-evt}∪E_{evt-ent}∪E_{ent-ent}}

N_evt: events,

N_ent: entities, 

E_{evt-ent}: relations between events,

E_{evt-ent}: relations between events and entities,

E_{ent-ent}: relations between entities

Li(2020):first studied event graph schema induction, focusing on rich event components and event-event connections.

## Instance view of EKG

### Event extraction

There are two subtasks, trigger detection and argument extraction. The former identifies the event trigger words and assigns them with predefined types or clustered classes, while the latter identifies the arguments and assigns them with argument roles of the triggered events.

Schema-based event extraction is further grouped into sentence- and document-level ones,and schema-free event extraction is also called open-domain one.

Sentence-level event extraction is more extensively studied nowadays, which extracts event triggers and arguments in a sentence.

### Event Relation Extraction

The main event relations are event temporal and causal relations. Causal relation is a subset of temporal relation.

More recent methods utilized neural networks to learn useful features for extraction automatically. Since pretrained language models perform well on many NLP tasks, researchers have introduced them, such as BERT, into event relation extraction.

Challenge : Event triggers can be verbs or nouns,but nouns are almost not considered.Another limitation is that they ignore arguments. 

### Event Coreference Resolution

Event coreference resolution is divided into within- and cross-document settings.Specifically, existing methods can be divided into unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised ones.

Challenge : Some methods only consider the within-document setting and cannot handle the cross-document one

### Event Argument Completion

Challenge: (1)Ignore event relations (2)researchers simplify event argument completion as inferring a missing argument or argument role. However, the argument role and its argument are usually both missing.

## Application View of EKG

* Basic Applications: Script event prediction, which is formalized as script coherence evaluation. We can represented events as (subject, predicate) or (predicate, object) pairs.Temporal KG Prediction, which is to predict events for future timestamps given the historical temporal KG and performs argument or predicate prediction with other elements of future events given.

* Deep Applications: For example, search, timeline generation, temporal KG prediction and question-answering.

## Future Direction

* High-performance Event Acquisition
* Multi-modal Knowledge Processing
* Interpretable EKG Research
* Practical EKG Research

## Conclusion

EKG is important for many applications, such as search, question-answering, recommendation, financial quantitative investments, and text generation. This paper presents a survey on EKG from different views comprehensively. Specially, we looked deep into the history, ontology, instance, and application views of EKG. Its history, definition, schema induction, acquisition, related representative graphs/systems, and applications are thoroughly studied.
