## LLM

### *What do LLMs Know about Financial Markets? A Case Study on Reddit Market Sentiment Analysis*

Lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. Instead, we approach this problem using semi-supervised learning with a large language model (LLM). This paper generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. Prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. **Though production applications of THE model are limited by ethical considerations**, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation.
