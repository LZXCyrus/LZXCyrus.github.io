# About Me

I am an undergraduate majoring in Data Science and Big Data of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

I am interested in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), and have already done some works on the construction and application of Knowledge Graph (KG) , event eextracction and Large Language Models (LLM) that have recently emerged. My toolchains are as followed: 

-**Python & R & Matlab**, Familiar

-**SQL & Office & Latex & Markdown**, Familiar&Learning

-**Tablue & Neo4j & Anylogic**, Learning

Besides my status as a student, I have various weird hobbies. I am also a fanatical fan of Borussia Dortmund, very amateurish astronomy hobbyist, LEGO enthusiast, Spanish beginner and amateur novel writer (James Joyce is the writer I admire most).
