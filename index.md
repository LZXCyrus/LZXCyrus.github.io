# About Me

I am an undergraduate majoring in Data Science and Big Data of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Financial Intelligence, and have done some study and works on Knowledge Graph (KG), Event Extraction and Large Language Models (LLM) prompt and fine-tuning.

Besides my status as a student, I have various hobbies. I am also a LEGO enthusiast, Spanish beginner and very amateurish novel writer (James Joyce is the writer I admire most).
