# About Me

I am an undergraduate majoring in Data Science and Big Data of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

I am interested in natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal machine learning (MMML), and have done some study and works on the construction and application of Knowledge Graph (KG) , event extraction and Large Language Models (LLM) tuning. My toolchains are as followed: 

-**Python · R · Matlab**, Familiar

-**SQL · Office · Latex**, Familiar&Learning

-**Tablue · Neo4j · Anylogic · C++**, Learning

Besides my status as a student, I have various weird hobbies. I am also a very amateurish astronomy hobbyist, LEGO enthusiast, Spanish beginner and amateur novel writer (James Joyce is the writer I admire most).
