# About Me

I am an undergraduate majoring in Data Science and Big Data of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

I am interested in natural language processing (NLP) and financial intelligence, and have done some study and works on the construction and application of Knowledge Graph (KG) , event extraction and Large Language Models (LLM) tuning.

Besides my status as a student, I have various weird hobbies. I am also a very amateurish astronomy hobbyist, LEGO enthusiast, Spanish beginner and amateur novel writer (James Joyce is the writer I admire most).
